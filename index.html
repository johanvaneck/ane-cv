					<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
					<p>
						I believe that it is my responsibility to inspire and motivate students
						to
						become responsible and ethical professionals. By fostering critical,
						moral and
						innovative thinking, I aim to shape good corporate citizens,
						contributing to an
						enhanced society.
					</p>
					<p>
						To shape these professionals, students need more than just technical
						knowledge
						in Accounting and Auditing. They must also understand how professionals
						in these
						fields think and solve problems. To achieve this, I bring real-life
						examples to
						class and inspire students through exposure to different professionals,
						issues
						and examples, making the professional world real and tangible. This
						approach
						helps students appreciate the profession and prepare for the world of
						work,
						making them well-rounded, employable graduates.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe that all students have the ability and natural aptitude to
						learn but
						that they do so differently. In order to cater for these different
						learning
						styles, a variety of tools need to be used to help them learn. I also
						believe
						that the best way to learn is to do the work yourself and, therefore,
						encourage
						student engagement and self-awareness through reflection. This is true
						for both
						students and educators, and therefore, I also prioritise testing new
						teaching
						initiatives, obtaining feedback, and actively reflecting on my teaching
						practices.
					</p>
					<p>
						I aspire to send individuals into the workforce who not only know the
						subject
						but also know themselves – their capabilities, value, opportunities to
						improve
						and ability to influence what matters – and the guts to do it…

						As an enthusiastic <span class="pop animate-pulse">lecturer</span>, I

						areas and
						how they fit into the world they will step into. I have a deep-rooted
						passion
						for ethics and a genuine desire to shape the leaders of tomorrow by
						nurturing
						traits like integrity, professionalism, and ethical leadership. It is my
						belief
						that by sowing these seeds today, we can cultivate a more responsible

						I am also the <span class="pop animate-pulse">Year-Group

						Post-Graduate Diploma in General Accountancy, and B.Com Honours
						(Accounting)
						programmes. In this role, I oversee the administrative aspects of these

						Teaching Approach Practice & Effectiveness
					</h2>
					<p>
						I see myself as a facilitator of learning. My role is to guide my
						students to become independent, life-long learners. I firmly support the
						words of Terry Doyle (2018): “Whoever does the work, does the learning”,
						and I believe that it is my responsibility to optimise the opportunities
						for my students to learn. This emphasises the necessity to include
						different modes of teaching in my modules, and I, therefore, try to
						follow a blended methodology to cater to my students' different learning
						needs. My view of blended learning does not only include the traditional
						“online” and “face-to-face” components but also includes spaces where
						students can learn outside of the class and online environments.
					</p>
					<h3>
						EACG3708/EAUD5808/EAUD6808: Auditing and Corporate Governance
					</h3>
					<p>
						Auditing and Corporate Governance are concepts that are mostly
						unfamiliar to students when they enter the higher education space. The
						other core modules of my students (Financial Accounting, Taxation and
						Management Accounting) are not so foreign to them as they have been
						exposed to elements of these modules at school and in life in general.
						With Auditing and Corporate Governance, the concepts are abstract and
						removed from what my students have dealt with previously, making it very
						difficult to understand and envision. I am, therefore, very deliberate
						in specifically including real/actual experiences and content, bringing
						students closer to the real world. Through most of these experiences, I
						also place emphasis on developing students’ pervasive skills and
						graduate attributes. This aligns not only with SAICA’s Competency
						Framework (which is the framework that the School of Accountancy needs
						to apply for purposes of accreditation of our programmes with SAICA) but
						also with the UFS Vision 130.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that I share this module with my colleague, Nadia Kganakga, and she
						covers 50% of the content. The table below sets out the interventions
						that I incorporate and methods I employ in some of the larger units of
						the Auditing and Corporate Governance module that I am responsible for.
						Please follow the related links for evidence of the various
						interventions.

										expectation gap (Quick, 2020), and I
										believe that proper education on the
										matter can really narrow the gap to some

										detect fraud is addressed in auditing
										standards, but for students to truly
										understand an auditor’s role, they must
										first understand fraud itself.

									<p>
										In addition to the Steinheist assignment

										In the same way that I guide students

						In addition to the above, I implemented the following interventions to

						development which is not limited to a specific module.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Industry Visits
					</h3>
					<img class="mt-2 rounded" src="assets/industry-visits.png" alt="">
					<p>
						I have utilised strong connections with industry to enable students to
						make on-site visits to big organisations in Bloemfontein. I have secured
						a sponsorship from Interstate Buslines to transport our students between
						campus and these companies, which is central to the success of this
						initiative, given the large student group (approximately 300 students).
						Students then have the choice of which company they would like to visit,
						as all companies are in different industries. These include Windmill
						Casino (Entertainment), SA Truck Bodies (Manufacturing), Interstate
						Buslines (Transportation) and the Raubex Group (Construction).
					</p>
					<p>
						When students visit these companies, they are taken on a tour through
						the operations site and listen to presentations from the finance teams.
						They have the opportunity to ask questions and engage with professionals
						who are doing the work that they are aiming towards. This really does
						wonders for students’ motivation and inspires them to work hard to reach
						these goals. These visits develop students’ business acumen, break down
						silos between modules (as they see how modules integrate) and enhance
						students’ view of the relevance of their course/studies. Students are
						also required to write a <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5oJzqpMGdKgvbBKJu6LjKulSiqChudl/view?usp=drive_link">reflective

					<p>
						In 2023, I started the initiative to host an annual Business Acumen Day,
						each year with a different focus. In 2023, the Business Acumen Day had
						an Auditing focus, while in 2024, the focus was on Governance and
						Sustainability.
					</p>
					<p>
						On this day, I invite high-profile speakers to address our students on
						relevant topics. The effect that these speakers have on students is
						truly inspiring. They relate to these speakers as role models and
						actively engage with them through questions and answer sessions after
						the presentations.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2023, I secured Standards Bank as a sponsor for the event, and the
						speakers included:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Rob Rose (editor of the Financial Mail and author of
							Steinheist,
							which is the book that the docuseries Steinheist is
							based on;
							refer to the Unit on the King IV Report on Corporate
							Governance
							above);
						</li>
						<li>
							Patricia Stock CA(SA) (at the time, an inspiring Audit
							Partner
							and subsequently appointed as the CEO of SAICA);
						</li>
						<li>
							Conrad de Wee (SAICA National Council member); and
						</li>
						<li>
							Prof Bernard Agulhas (former Audit Regulator/CEO of IRBA
							and
							adjunct professor at the SoA).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						In 2024, we partnered with the Institute of Directors (IoDSA) to host
						this event and the speakers were:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Ansie Ramalho (Chair of the King Committee responsible
							for
							drafting the King IV Report);
						</li>
						<li>
							Prof Parmi Natesan (CEO of the IoD and adjunct professor
							at the
							SoA);
						</li>
						<li>
							Felicia Msiza (CEO of the Raubex Group, the largest road
							construction company in Africa); and
						</li>
						<li>
							Rob Rose (as a repeat from last year, given his
							insightful
							presentations and deep knowledge in the financial world
							as a
							renowned, award-winning financial journalist).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						This event is hosted in the Callie Human as we invite not only my
						students but also all students in the SoA (second year up to
						post-graduate). The invitation sent to students can be viewed here: <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVRjeZ-FJCiOp1-DuPl3RqJZXHQW64W6/view?usp=drive_link">2023</a>
						and <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZCFHQwuTFYcCbPHYstDSzeKWQ1skHmlV/view?usp=drive_link">2024</a>.
						In addition to the student event, we also host a panel
						discussion with the same speakers, to which SoA stakeholders are
						invited. This strengthens the School’s relationship with various
						stakeholders, such as those hosting our students at Industry Visits.

						Through the strong connection built with Coventry University,
						England
						(refer to the COIL Project addressed in the table above), I was
						<a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gx8JBHdihtZRRbQqI6Kg53n1yawZVhLA/view?usp=drive_link">invited</a>
						by Coventry University to bring students to their International
						Audit
						Week, hosted annually in October. I solely raised R250 000 from
						external
						funders, which enabled me and Prof Frans Prinsloo to take five
						of the
						School of Accountancy’s top-performing students to England at
						the end of
						last year.
					</p>
					<p>
						The 2025 International Audit Week is scheduled to either take place in
						the Netherlands or in Switzerland and I have already raised R100 000 for
						this purpose, while awaiting feedback from other funders.
					</p>
					<p>
						We often focus so much on students who struggle, and rightfully so, but
						we tend to forget to reward our top-performing students. This initiative
						serves just that purpose and, through proper exposure, should motivate
						top scholars in the Free State to study with the UFS SoA. This
						initiative also addresses the UFS Vision 130 focus on
						Internationalisation.

						Promotion of Student Learning
					</h2>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						Student Body
					</h3>
					<p>
						For the EACG3708/EAUD5808/EAUD6808: Auditing and Corporate Governance
						modules that I teach, my students are rather diverse. This group
						includes students who are either enrolled in their final year of B.
						Accounting or the post-graduate programmes after completing their B.Com
						(Accounting) degree. In 2024, the student body in these modules included
						250 students, comprising 106 B.Acc third year, 95 B.Com Hons., and 49
						PGDipGA students. The gender distribution is 143 females to 107 males,
						with a racial composition of 211 African, 11 Coloured, 26 White and 2
						Indian students. Among these, 180 are first-time attendees, while 70 are
						repeating the course, including 12 students repeating to improve their
						marks for B.Acc Honors admission. The numbers for 2025 are still a work
						in progress and should be confirmed after the first semester tests’ data
						is available. I am privileged to have had Jana Lamprecht as a colleague
						in this module until 2024, who utilised advanced Excel and Power BI
						tools to analyse statistics and track student success. These statistics
						enable us to address student-specific needs and track student success
						and challenges.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Challenges faced by students that hinder their success
					</h3>
					<p>
						I have identified three key issues that students struggle with in these
						programmes, which include:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Time management when writing assessments
						</li>
						<li>
							A focussing too much on theory and neglecting
							application
						</li>
						<li>
							Not learning from mistakes by doing proper post-mortems
							on their
							assessments.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I, therefore, make deliberate time to address these issues in class by
						demonstrating techniques to address these challenges. For example, I use
						the analogy of sport (I let students pick a sport and adapt to that).
						The discussion on Theory vs Application includes the following:
					</p>
					<p>
						“Do you think Christiano Ronaldo (world-renowned football player) spends
						time in the gym as well as practising skills on the football field?
						[Students agree.] What do you think will happen if he only goes to the
						gym and never sets foot on the field? He will surely be very fit, but he
						would lack the skills needed to win the match. What would happen if he
						only spent time on the field and never set foot in the gym? He will have
						great skills and football abilities, and while he might not be as fit as
						one would hope, he will also gain some fitness on the field by running
						around and being active. He might still have a chance to win the match.
						It works the same with studies.
					</p>
					<img class="rounded" src="assets/gym.png" alt="">
					<p>
						If you want to be the best, you need to make time for both Gym/Theory
						and Field practice/Questions. But if time is limited and you need to
						compromise on one, it can never be the practical part. Through
						practising questions (field practice), you get the skills needed for the
						examination, but naturally, you also learn at least some of the theory
						(fitness) through this process. This way, you still have a chance to do
						well in the test/exam (match).”
					</p>
					<p>
						Students naturally start with studying theory but often spend so much
						time on the theory that they neglect the practical application. I have
						received very positive feedback from students on the difference it made
						when they changed their approach to a more practical one.
					</p>
					<p>
						My previous colleague in this module, Jana, and I also designed a
						post-mortem form that students need to complete after their assessments.
						This serves as a reflection on their learning, successes and mistakes
						and guides them through the process. So many students have told us that,
						when faced with poor test results, they cannot face it and just ignore
						it. We, however, believe that tests are a learning opportunity, and if
						students do not use them to learn from their mistakes, they tend to
						repeat the same/similar mistakes in future assessments. The post-mortem
						form is adapted with each assessment, but an example can be viewed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9eB4WSxEgDTUr9ZRKOnpJovcqgk-5lS/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Learning and Teaching Strategies and Promoting Students’ Understanding
						of the Module
					</h3>
					<p>
						Strategies employed in this module to promote student learning and their
						understanding of the module include a blended learning approach with
						deliberate integration of the real world. This is discussed fully under
						the Teaching Approach, Practice and Effectiveness above.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, content materials are made available to students in a
						carefully structured manner. Given that students’ time is so limited in
						the Accountancy programmes, I do not want students to waste unnecessary
						time wondering what they need to do and where they can find the
						information. Each unit in the module has a detailed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQUe8S9o2Evu_jThcQgHnISerRd5wXIG/view?usp=drive_link">unit
							guide</a> (per unit
						within the module), while I also provide a <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13OM6B5XaQX08jmUdxKzRWV7_4dGGSw-k/view?usp=drive_link">roadmap</a>
						to each unit as a
						quick reference guide to what students should prepare for class, what
						will be done in class and what should be done afterwards.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Insights into student learning
					</h3>
					<p>
						In addition to the insights mentioned above, I am very deliberate in
						obtaining feedback from our students, not only on our personal lecturing
						styles but also on the way that students experience different
						interventions, material, etc. Through this, we also obtain information
						on the challenges that they experience and the changes that they would
						like to see in the module. We do this with formal evaluations (in
						addition to those done by the EMS Teaching and Learning Office), as we
						value module-specific feedback, enabling us to reflect deeply on the
						feedback and respond appropriately. An example of this feedback form can
						be viewed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u2HRKWg4poIoNF79QozkrTiXVJmuklzw/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
						In response to the feedback received from students, we
						have, for example, changed the order in which topics are presented to
						enable more learning opportunities on certain topics before the
						examination.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="tab-content" id="leadership">
					<h2>
						Student development and support (including student discipline)
					</h2>
					<p>
						Various initiatives are described in the previous sections, addressing
						the
						development of graduate attributes, such as business acumen, digital
						skills, writing skills and communication skills. Students are also
						actively and continuously encouraged to consult with lecturers and
						academic trainees. My WhatsApp number is available to students to enable
						them to ask a quick question when they get stuck. I welcome voice notes
						(and send many of them!) to help students progress when studying. I do
						not want students to take an hour out of their day to walk to campus and
						back when they can just ask quickly on WhatsApp. Oftentimes, the problem
						is bigger than a WhatsApp response, and then I spent time with in-person
						consultations.
					</p>
					<p>
						My students generally do not misuse my personal number. We have a good
						relationship and mutual respect. I do my best to help them as quickly as
						possible, and they understand that I have other responsibilities and
						personal commitments. I genuinely care for my students and believe that
						this makes me approachable when students are in need of support. Refer
						to the Reflection and Feedback section below for more details.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also dealt with difficult student disciplinary cases, as
						evidenced by the <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vg4spvcbnWMEKGxMLnKcI7NbnW7i7uxC/view?usp=drive_link">linked
							documentation</a>. I take the academic misconduct of
						students very seriously, as this directly filters into the professionals
						that we are sending into the workplace. Nonetheless, with the specific
						student referred to in the linked communication, I spent more than an
						hour consulting with him in my office after his sanction, unpacking the
						situation and supporting the student in his decisions further. Everyone
						makes mistakes, and we can all do with some support and kindness when
						this happens.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Curriculum & Course Development
					</h2>
					<p>
						In addition to ensuring that the EACG3708/EAUD5808/EAUD6808 modules
						align with the SAICA Competency Framework, I also played a pivotal role
						in designing and developing the EOEC2614 (Organisational Ethics and
						Citizenship) module, which was presented for the first time in 2024 to
						Accounting, Public Administration and Finance students in the EMS
						faculty.
					</p>
					<p>
						The module is designed to be fully blended, with two hours of online
						(mostly pre-recorded) lectures and a two-hour practical session, which
						takes place face-to-face. Various lecturers assist in recording lectures
						and presenting practical classes on both the Bloemfontein and Qwaqwa
						campuses. I facilitate and coordinate the collaboration on this module.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the online lectures and in-person practical classes,
						students need to address and submit various case studies in different
						settings to practice and display their ethical reasoning in common
						business ethics dilemmas. Students double peer-review each other’s case
						study submissions as this facilitates reflection. When students review
						their peers’ work, it also gives them different perspectives and
						broadens their ethical reasoning and critical thinking.
					</p>
					<p>
						An ethics project is also done in this module, whereby students need to
						do a presentation on an ethical dilemma in business. Student work in
						teams and submit a video of their presentation. This develops teamwork,
						digital skills and, most importantly, communication and presentation
						skills. An example of such a submission is included <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NbYv-VMz65G6bgQclvQCmLcgbaYiAAD_/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						New technologies are embraced in this module, with the use of Feedback
						Fruits in recorded lectures. This enables video recordings to stop at
						certain times, requiring students to answer content-specific questions
						before they can continue. This ensures that students truly engage with
						the content and not only play videos without watching them. In addition,
						live quizzes are used in class through the platform <a
							href="https://quizizz.com">quizizz.com</a>
						to encourage engagement and facilitated discussions in face-to-face
						classes, especially given the large size of the class (800+ students).
					</p>
					<p>
						To facilitate quality and consistency in this module, a standard
						approach to content development was followed, which included the
						preparation/presentation of the following per unit (links to examples
						included):
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>

					<h2>
						Assessment Practices
					</h2>
					<p>
						I firmly believe that assessment drives performance, and therefore, I
						include multiple assessment opportunities in my modules. I design formal
						semester tests (summative assessments) as case studies that students are
						likely to encounter in practice, and the outcomes are aligned with the
						SAICA Competency Framework. These assessments are cumulative and,
						therefore, aid in students’ deep and continuous learning. My assessments
						are moderated by the Director of the School (being a subject matter
						expert), and the feedback on my assessments rarely requires significant
						changes. An example of moderation feedback can be viewed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kA9SeCL_gltN8sDYoaRkWdEluw9zGaqU/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>,
						while an
						example of an assessment can be viewed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13yM89aCB3rWMQuZBTQqwVRf4jIuJQqOX/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
						Note that 50% of
						assessments are prepared by my colleague, Nadia Kganakga, as we share
						this module.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also incorporate various formative assessments, which include scoped
						class tests (enabling students to focus on a specific element at a
						time), quizzes and assignments. The assessment breakdown for my module
						is as follows:
					</p>
					<img class="m-4 rounded" src="assets/table.png" alt="">

						Please see Insights into Student Learning under Promotion of Student
						Learning for how assessments are utilised as reflection and learning
						opportunities for students. I have also designed <a

						Mentoring & Coaching
					</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="pop">Students</span> often consult with me on matters other
						than technical academic
						content. This includes issues of emotional wellness, being overwhelmed,
						time management, study techniques and even relationships. I see this as
						a necessary part of being a lecturer, as I am to send well-rounded
						individuals into the workplace.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also had to guide two new <span class="pop">colleagues</span>
						appointed in the SoA in
						2023/2024, Dakalo Nelwamondo (BFN) and Hannali Labuschagne (QQ). I
						guided them through the practical parts of teaching at the UFS
						(classroom technologies, Blackboard, assessments, etc.) and moderated
						their assessments and learning materials. For approximately four months,
						I scheduled weekly MS Teams meetings with them to check in and unpack
						various challenges. This year (2025) I again have a new colleague, Nadia
						Kganakga, for whom I serve as the <strong>Onboarding Buddy</strong>, and
						guiding her not
						only through the general University matters, but also matter specific to
						the module that we share.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am also responsible for guiding and reviewing the competencies of
						academic trainees who are appointed to the SoA on an annual basis. This
						is done through the SAICA Electronic Assessment Tool. In addition to
						trainees’ official technical and pervasive skills, we often have
						check-in meetings to unpack their challenges, and I try to guide them in
						their approach and reasoning.

						Reflection & Feedback
					</h2>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						Self reflection
					</h3>
					<p>
						In the same way that I encourage my students to reflect and improve on
						their mistakes, I view reflection as an absolute necessity in teaching
						excellence and academic leadership. I particularly reflect on my
						students’ assessment results, as well as the presentation of each unit,
						to note what worked and what should be changed in future lessons. An
						example of such a reflection can be viewed <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HLH9DtynPQZymF0BMslvL53XjoAKwZCk/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.
					</p>
					<h3 class="mt-2">
						Student feedback
					</h3>
					<p>
						As described under <em>Promotion of Student Learning</em>, I obtain
						detailed
						student feedback through module evaluations that we conduct in addition
						to the EMS standard evaluations, as this provides us with insights into
						student learning. This evaluation is done with manual forms (as we
						receive more student responses in this way compared to online surveys),
						and the data is then captured independently by a colleague within the
						SoA. In addition to evaluating the module and material and highlighting
						challenges, part of this process includes a lecturer-specific
						evaluation. My most recent individual results were as follows:
					</p>
					<img class="rounded" src="assets/graph.png" alt="">
					<p>
						In addition to the formal evaluations, I often receive informal feedback
						from students through notes, emails and WhatsApp messages. This is the
						kind of feedback that I appreciate most, as these messages are sincere
						and not forced. I have included copies of most of these messages <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jekvu9o0AkbrMIZ1VDAZY2ElQQqb1N0V/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>
						and some below.
						It is in these messages that one can see love and care for students. It
						is easy to compile portfolios that look impressive, but sincere feedback
						is what should, in my view, carry the most weight.

						The strong industry connections that I have built over the years have
						enabled many of the initiatives mentioned in previous sections, both
						practically and financially. I regularly present training on personal,
						business and professional ethics to practitioners and trainees in the
						Accountancy Profession, both locally and internationally. This includes
						training on behalf of:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA)
						</li>
						<li>
							The South African Institute of Professional Accountants (SAIPA)
						</li>
						<li>
							The Namibian Institute of Professional Accountants (NIPA)
						</li>
						<li>
							The Chartered Institute of Business Accountants (CIBA)
						</li>
						<li>
							Pro-Beta Training
						</li>
						<li>
							Various small and medium-sized Accountancy firms.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						In my role as a professional trainer, I am regularly consulted by the
						profession on matters surrounding ethics and governance.

						I currently serve on the Ethics Committee of SAICA, which is a national
						board-elected committee. I have previously served on the district, Free
						State and Central Region structures of SAICA for a period of 9 years.

						Previously, I have also set questions for the SAICA national board
						examination (Initial Test of Competence).
